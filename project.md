SELLEROPS
The Seller War Room for Next-Gen Marketplaces

Normal dashboards tell sellers what happened.
SellerOps tells them who did it, why it happened, and what to do next.

1️⃣ THE CORE PROBLEM (REAL, PAINFUL, IGNORED)

Marketplace sellers today suffer from silent failure:

Sales drop → no explanation

Refunds rise → no root cause

Competitors undercut → noticed too late

Ads burn money → no attribution clarity

Existing tools show:

Charts

Tables

Vanity metrics

But no decisions.

SellerOps exists to answer only one question:

“What should I do RIGHT NOW to not lose money?”

That framing alone wins judges.

2️⃣ WHAT SELLEROPS ACTUALLY IS

SellerOps = Real-time Decision Intelligence for Sellers

Not analytics.
Not BI.
Not “insights”.

It’s a command center that:

Detects threats

Explains causes

Suggests actions

Simulates outcomes

Think:

Stripe Dashboard + War Strategy + AI Analyst

3️⃣ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (CONCEPTUAL, NOT CODE)

SellerOps thinks in four layers:

Layer 1: Signal Intake (Raw Reality)

SellerOps continuously ingests:

Orders

Refunds

Search impressions

Cart abandonments

Competitor price snapshots

Shipping delays

Payment failures

These are signals, not metrics.

Layer 2: Event Detection (Something Changed)

Instead of charts, SellerOps fires events:

Examples:

“Conversion dropped unusually fast”

“Refund reason changed pattern”

“Traffic is stable but revenue fell”

“Competitor price moved below you”

This is where ML shines.

Layer 3: Cause Engine (WHY, not WHAT)

This is the killer differentiator.

SellerOps doesn’t say:

“Sales down 18%”

It says:

“Sales down 18% because:

Competitor X dropped price by 7%

Your delivery ETA increased by 1.4 days

Mobile checkout failures rose after 11pm”

That’s causality, not correlation.

Layer 4: Action Engine (DO THIS)

Every alert ends with actions, not advice.

Examples:

“Reduce price by ₹120 to regain Buy Box”

“Pause ads for SKU-221 (negative ROI detected)”

“Switch courier to avoid refund surge”

“Enable fast checkout for high-intent users”

This is where judges go: “Oh.”

4️⃣ SELLER WAR ROOM UI (VERY IMPORTANT)
4
The UI Philosophy

Dark mode

Minimal charts

High-contrast alerts

Tactical language

Main Sections
🔥 LIVE STATUS BAR

Top of the screen:

Revenue velocity (↑ ↓)

Risk score

Opportunity score

No numbers without direction.

🚨 THREAT FEED (Like a Security Console)

Scrolling feed:

“Refund spike detected — SKU 334”

“Competitor price attack detected”

“Checkout friction rising on mobile”

Each alert:

Severity

Confidence %

Suggested action

🧠 WHY PANEL (Explainability)

Click any alert → SellerOps explains:

What changed

When

Compared to what baseline

Why the model thinks this matters

Judges LOVE explainability.

⚔️ ACTION PANEL

One-click actions:

Apply price change

Pause ads

Trigger promotion

Mark as ignored (model learns)

This shows control, not automation chaos.

5️⃣ THE “RAHH” / BEAST MODE FEATURE 🐲

This is where SellerOps wins the hackathon.

🔥 BEAST MODE: AUTO-DEFENSE SIMULATION

SellerOps lets sellers simulate outcomes before acting.

Example:

“If I drop price by 5%:

Revenue: +12%

Margin: −3%

Competitor response probability: 62%”

Or:

“If I keep price unchanged:

Sales loss in 24h: −18%”

This is game theory for sellers.

No one else does this.

6️⃣ WHY THIS DESTROYS JUDGING CRITERIA
✅ Complexity & Technicality (30%)

Event detection

Causal inference

Real-time data

ML explainability

✅ Impact & Utility (30%)

Saves money

Prevents losses

Helps sellers act fast

✅ Design & UX (20%)

War room UI

Alert-first design

Minimal cognitive load

✅ “RAHH” Factor (20%)

Aggressive language

Threat detection

Simulation engine

Sellers feel powerful

7️⃣ WHY JUDGES WILL REMEMBER THIS

Most teams will say:

“We built a seller dashboard.”

You’ll say:

“We built a real-time seller defense system that detects threats, explains causes, and suggests counter-moves.”

That’s a mental reframe, not a feature.
